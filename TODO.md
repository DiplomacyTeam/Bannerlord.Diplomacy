# Diplomacy: To-Do


## Higher Priority

#### Compatibility with BL e1.5.7

- ~~GUI compatibility~~
- Compile-time compatibility
  + End usage of `StatExplainer`
- Harmony patch compatibility
  + Full review of all patched methods for semantic correctness


## Normal Priority


#### Deactivate 'Usurp Throne' feature

- Deactivation itself
- Rearrangement of UI buttons to again look decent without it


## Lower Priority

- Address the hundreds of nullability warnings inherited from DiplomacyFixes.

- Convert complete overrides of vanilla GUI Prefabs to UIExtenderEx patches for better compatibility and more robustness to vanilla changes.
