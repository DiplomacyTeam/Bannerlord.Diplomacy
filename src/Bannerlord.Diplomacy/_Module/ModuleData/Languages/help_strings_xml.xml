    <string id="bAkTqxmf" text="A faction is a group of clans in a kingdom with a common goal. If a faction gains enough support, they will begin a civil war. If the rebels wins the war, their demand will be upheld. If the loyalists win, the rebel clans will return to the kingdom. Victorious clans will gain influence and relations with their fellow victors. Defeated clans will lose influence. Clans may start a faction by spending influence." />
	
	<string id="XXUwW6TM" text="War exhaustion tracks how close a kingdom is to surrender. Once war exhaustion reaches 100%, the kingdom will surrender. Casualties, lost fiefs, villages being raided, and the duration of the war all contribute to war exhaustion. When a kingdom loses its last fief, it can no longer sustain its war effort effectively, which not only immediately increases its current war exhaustion, but also drastically increases the daily amount of war exhaustion it receives - until the kingdom either surrenders or regain at least one fief." />
	
	<string id="dh2NE8Of" text="The war exhaustion rate is the rate at which war exhaustion accumulates in the war. War exhaustion accumulates  more slowly in wars between larger kingdoms."/>
