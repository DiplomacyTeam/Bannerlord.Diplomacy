# Diplomacy

Diplomacy is a fork of a popular Bannerlord mod, now on life support for being unmaintained for quite a long period, called Diplomacy Fixes. I intend to solve its issues, drop/add a few features according to my own game design and simulation aesthetic, upgrade it into tenable and highly stable state, and then I'll release Diplomacy's first version.

Plans beyond that initial release -- in which it is basically a reliable Diplomacy Fixes on steroids -- are very ambitious in terms of new gameplay mechanics, and that is why I chose the simplified name of "Diplomacy."
