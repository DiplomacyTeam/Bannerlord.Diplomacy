# Diplomacy

Diplomacy is a fork of a popular Bannerlord mod, now on life support for being unmaintained for quite a long period, called Diplomacy Fixes. I intend to solve its issues, drop/add a few features according to my own game design and simulation aesthetic, upgrade it into tenable and highly stable state, and then I'll release Diplomacy's first version.

Plans beyond that initial release -- in which it is basically a reliable Diplomacy Fixes on steroids -- are very ambitious in terms of new gameplay mechanics, and that is why I chose the simplified name of "Diplomacy."

Once the mod reaches v1.0.0 and I've established a solid base from its origins in Diplomacy Fixes:

As always with my projects, quality contributions are welcome, and I am extremely open to collaboration. If you want to work on an all new feature or something that would affect the vision of the mod, however, then please contact me to discuss beforehand, as I'm a stickler for maintaining a coherent vision in game (and software) design.
